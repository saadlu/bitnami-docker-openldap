# What is OpenLDAP?

> [OpenLDAP](https://openldap.org/) is the open-source solution for LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol). It is a protocol used to store and retrieve data from a hierarchical directory structure such as in databases.

# TL;DR

```console
$ docker run --name openldap bitnami/openldap:latest
```

## Docker Compose

```console
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-openldap/master/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up -d
```

# Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released daily with the latest distribution packages available.

# Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/work-with-non-root-containers/).

# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/understand-rolling-tags-containers/).


* [`2`, `2-debian-10`, `2.4.56`, `2.4.56-debian-10-r28`, `latest` (2/debian-10/Dockerfile)](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-openldap/blob/2.4.56-debian-10-r28/2/debian-10/Dockerfile)

# Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami OpenLDAP Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/openldap).

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/openldap:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/openldap/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/openldap:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```console
$ docker build -t bitnami/openldap:latest 'https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-openldap.git#master:2/debian-10'
```

# Connecting to other containers

Using [Docker container networking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/), a different server running inside a container can easily be accessed by your application containers and vice-versa.

Containers attached to the same network can communicate with each other using the container name as the hostname.

## Using the Command Line

In this example, we will use a MariaDB Galera instance that will use a OpenLDAP instance that is running on the same docker network to manage authentication.

### Step 1: Create a network

```console
$ docker network create my-network --driver bridge
```

### Step 2: Launch the OpenLDAP server instance

Use the `--network <NETWORK>` argument to the `docker run` command to attach the container to the `my-network` network.

```console
$ docker run --detach --rm --name openldap \
  --network my-network \
  --env LDAP_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin \
  --env LDAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=adminpassword \
  --env LDAP_USERS=customuser \
  --env LDAP_PASSWORDS=custompassword \
  bitnami/openldap:latest
```

### Step 3: Launch the MariaDB Galera server instance

Use the `--network <NETWORK>` argument to the `docker run` command to attach the container to the `my-network` network.

```console
$ docker run --detach --rm --name mariadb-galera \
    --network my-network \
    --env MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=root-password \
    --env MARIADB_GALERA_MARIABACKUP_PASSWORD=backup-password \
    --env MARIADB_USER=customuser \
    --env MARIADB_DATABASE=customdatabase \
    --env MARIADB_ENABLE_LDAP=yes \
    --env LDAP_URI=ldap://openldap:1389 \
    --env LDAP_ROOT=dc=example,dc=org \
    --env LDAP_BIND_DN=cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org \
    --env LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD=adminpassword \
    bitnami/mariadb-galera:latest
```

### Step 4: Launch the MariaDB client and test you can authenticate using LDAP credentials

Finally we create a new container instance to launch the MariaDB client and connect to the server created in the previous step:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm --name mariadb-client \
    --network my-network \
    bitnami/mariadb-galera:latest mysql -h mariadb-galera -u customuser -D customdatabase -pcustompassword
```

## Using Docker Compose

When not specified, Docker Compose automatically sets up a new network and attaches all deployed services to that network. However, we will explicitly define a new `bridge` network named `my-network`. In this example we assume that you want to connect to the OpenLDAP server from your own custom application image which is identified in the following snippet by the service name `myapp`.

```yaml
version: '2'

networks:
  my-network:
    driver: bridge
services:
  openldap:
    image: bitnami/openldap:2
    ports:
      - '1389:1389'
      - '1636:1636'
    environment:
      - LDAP_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
      - LDAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=adminpassword
      - LDAP_USERS=user01,user02
      - LDAP_PASSWORDS=password1,password2
    networks:
      - my-network
    volumes:
      - 'openldap_data:/bitnami/openldap'
  myapp:
    image: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_IMAGE'
    networks:
      - my-network
volumes:
  openldap_data:
    driver: local
```

> **IMPORTANT**:
>
> 1. Please update the **YOUR_APPLICATION_IMAGE_** placeholder in the above snippet with your application image
> 2. In your application container, use the hostname `openldap` to connect to the OpenLDAP server

Launch the containers using:

```console
$ docker-compose up -d
```

# Configuration

The Bitnami Docker OpenLDAP can be easily setup with the following environment variables:

- `LDAP_PORT_NUMBER`: The port OpenLDAP is listening for requests. Default: **1389** (non privileged port)
- `LDAP_ROOT`: LDAP database root node of the LDAP tree. Default: **dc=example,dc=org**
- `LDAP_ADMIN_USERNAME`: LDAP database admin user. Default: **admin**
- `LDAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: LDAP database admin password. Default: **adminpassword**
- `LDAP_USERS`: Comma separated list of LDAP users to create in the default LDAP tree. Default: **user01,user02**
- `LDAP_PASSWORDS`: Comma separated list of passwords to use for LDAP users. Default: **bitnami1,bitnami2**
- `LDAP_USER_DC`: DC for the users' organizational unit. Default: **users**
- `LDAP_GROUP`: Group used to group created users. Default: **readers**
- `LDAP_SKIP_DEFAULT_TREE`: Whether to skip creating the default LDAP tree based on `LDAP_USERS`, `LDAP_PASSWORDS`, `LDAP_USER_DC` and `LDAP_GROUP`. Default: **no**
- `LDAP_CUSTOM_LDIF_DIR`: Location of a directory that contains LDIF files that should be used to bootstrap the database. Only files ending in `.ldif` will be used. Default LDAP tree based on the `LDAP_USERS`, `LDAP_PASSWORDS`, `LDAP_USER_DC` and `LDAP_GROUP` will be skipped when `LDAP_CUSTOM_LDIF_DIR` is used. When using this will override the usage of `LDAP_ROOT`,`LDAP_USERS`, `LDAP_PASSWORDS`, `LDAP_USER_DC` and `LDAP_GROUP`. Default: **/ldifs**

Check the official [OpenLDAP Configuration Reference](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/guide.html) for more information about how to configure OpenLDAP.

# Logging

The Bitnami OpenLDAP Docker image sends the container logs to `stdout`. To view the logs:

```console
$ docker logs openldap
```

You can configure the containers [logging driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) using the `--log-driver` option if you wish to consume the container logs differently. In the default configuration docker uses the `json-file` driver.

# Maintenance
